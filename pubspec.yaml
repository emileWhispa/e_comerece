# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/home_banner@3x.png
   - assets/afrishop_logo@3x.png
   - assets/boys.jpg
   - assets/home.png
   - assets/home_.png
   - assets/discover.png
   - assets/discover_.png
   - assets/clement.jpeg
   - assets/cart.png
   - assets/cart_.png
   - assets/flutterwave.png
   - assets/dpo.jpg
   - assets/image.jpg
   - assets/imag1.jpg
   - assets/imag2.jpg
   - assets/imag3.jpg
   - assets/imag4.jpg
   - assets/imag5.jpg
   - assets/imag6.jpg
   - assets/imag7.jpg

   - assets/imag10.jpg
   - assets/account.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: Karla
     fonts:
          - asset: fonts/Karla-Bold.ttf
          - asset: fonts/Karla-BoldItalic.ttf
          - asset: fonts/Karla-Italic.ttf
          - asset: fonts/Karla-Regular.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
